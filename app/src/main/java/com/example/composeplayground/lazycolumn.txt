In Android's Jetpack Compose, LazyColumn is a highly efficient way to display scrollable lists.
It's analogous to RecyclerView in the traditional Android View system,
designed to only compose and lay out the visible items on the screen, thus improving performance for large lists.

Introduction to LazyColumn
LazyColumn is ideal for displaying a scrollable list where the number of items is large or unknown.
It only composes and lays out the items that are currently visible on the screen, recycling the item views as you scroll.
This lazy loading approach makes it much more efficient than a regular Column with a Scrollable modifier for large lists.
For complex items or items with images, consider using remember and key to maintain state and performance.

rememberLazyListState() is specifically for remembering the scroll position and state of a LazyColumn.
It's useful when you want to maintain the scroll position across recompositions, or if you need to programmatically control the scroll position.
