Modifiers in Jetpack Compose are powerful tools that allow you to modify the appearance and behavior of composables.
They are key to understanding how to build UIs in Compose effectively.
Modifiers are optional settings that you can apply to composables.
They can control layout aspects (like size and padding), drawing aspects (like background color and shape), and handle user input (like clicks).

Modifiers in Jetpack Compose are essential for designing and laying out your UI.
They offer a declarative approach to building UIs, where you describe how UI elements should look and behave.
Remember, the order of modifiers matters as it can affect how they are applied.
